# Hospital Ventilation Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of ventilation processes in NHS hospitals to improve energy efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. Using data from sensors tracking temperatures, pressures, and humidity, we developed a data-driven model to optimise the HVAC system.

## Project Goals
- Enhance the decision-making process through data analysis.
- Develop and implement a novel ventilation process.
- Reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions.

## Data Collection
- Conducted 5 site visits to gather sensor data on temperatures, pressures, and humidity.
- Cleaned and processed the data using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.

## Data Analysis
- Developed a comprehensive energy model of the hospital's HVAC system.
- Analysed pre- and post-implementation data to validate the new ventilation process.
- Utilised Plotly for interactive data visualisations to identify patterns and trends.

## Results
- Achieved a 15% increase in thermal effectiveness with the new heating coil component.
- Reduced energy consumption and CO2 emissions by 39.29%.
- Realised an annual carbon saving of 206.64 tonnes for the target hospital.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- NumPy and Pandas for data processing and cleaning
- Plotly for data visualisation
- ANSYS Fluent for modelling the heating coil component
- SIMULINK for validating thermal effectiveness
